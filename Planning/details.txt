1. No robot is active:
    * All robots are allowed to move
    * Robot LOADs for the first time:
        a. make robot active
        b. create a state for each path between the robot and a tap / plant except current position

        c. check if path is blocked
            i. if blocked - allow all robots to move
            ii. if not blocked -- set is_active_only == True
        d. set destination
        e. add to successor (no need to continue)
2. There is an active robot
    a. is_active_only == False AND destination != None:
        i. if active robot
            * check if there's a robot blocking the path.
                if not -- set is_active_only == True
            * if robot cords == active_session_initial_cords
                allow LOAD or moving on the path
            * else:
                allow moving on path
            * if moved on path, check if arrived at destination after moving
                * if arrived at destination:
                        b. create a state for each path between the robot and a tap / plant except current position
                        c. check if path is blocked
                            i. if blocked - allow all robots to move
                            ii. if not blocked -- set is_active_only == True
                        d. set destination
                        e. add to successor (no need to continue)
                        * active_session_initial_cords == current_robot_cords
                        * is_force_drink == True
                        * is_force_pour == True
        ii. if not active robot:
            Allow movement, not LOAD / POUR
    b. is_active_only == True:
        i. if not active robot, skip
        ii. if robot_cords == active_session_initial_cords:
            allow drinking, pouring or moving on the path
        iii. if not:
            allow moving on the path
        iv. if moved on the path, check if we arrived at destination, if so:




            * set is_active_only == False
            * set destination == None
            * active_session_initial_cords == None
            * is_force_drink == True
            * is_force_pour == True
    c. is_active_only == False AND destination == None:
        i. if is_force_drink == True AND sitting on tap:
            LOAD
            set is_force_drink, is_force_pour = False
        ii. if is_force_pour AND sitting on plant:
            POUR
            set is_force_drink, is_force_pour = False
        iii. allow all movement
